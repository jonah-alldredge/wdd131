                <p class="info">
                    My name is Jonah! I am currently serving as a Service Missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of
                    Latter-Day Saints.
                    I am so grateful for the opportunity I've had serving the Lord! I am also very grateful for the
                    opportunity
                    to be in school and learning how to code. It has been an uphill battle but I am always ready for a
                    challenge!

                    I live in the United States of America. I am from Utah! Utah is a western state in the United States known for its beautiful mountains, red rock deserts,
                    and outdoor
                    recreation. It is home to five national parks, vibrant communities, and a strong sense of history
                    and culture. Living in
                    Utah offers four distinct seasons, stunning scenery, and a high quality of life.
