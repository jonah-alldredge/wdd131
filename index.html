                My name is Jonah! I am currently serving as a Service Missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.
                I am so grateful for the opportunity I have had serving the Lord! I am also very grateful for the opportunity
                to be in school and learning how to code. It has been an uphill battle but I am always ready for a challenge!
            </p>

                Utah is a western state in the United States known for its beautiful mountains, red rock deserts, and outdoor
                recreation. It is home to five national parks, vibrant communities, and a strong sense of history and culture. Living in
                Utah offers four distinct seasons, stunning scenery, and a high quality of life.
